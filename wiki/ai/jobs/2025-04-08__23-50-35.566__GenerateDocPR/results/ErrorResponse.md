# ErrorResponse.java: Error Response Data Structure

## Overview
The `ErrorResponse` class is a simple data structure designed to encapsulate error information. It contains two attributes: `code` and `message`, which represent the error code and the corresponding error message, respectively. This class provides getter and setter methods for both attributes and a constructor for initialization.

## Process Flow
Since this is a data structure, the process flow is represented as a class diagram showing its attributes and methods.

```mermaid

    class ErrorResponse {
        - String code
        - String message
        + ErrorResponse(String code, String message)
        + String getCode()
        + void setCode(String code)
        + String getMessage()
        + void setMessage(String message)
    }
```

## Insights
- The class is designed to store error-related information, making it useful for error handling and reporting.
- It provides encapsulation through private attributes and public getter/setter methods.
- The constructor ensures that both `code` and `message` can be initialized at the time of object creation.
