# SupplierRepository Documentation

## Overview
The `SupplierRepository` is an interface that extends the `JpaRepository` provided by Spring Data JPA. It serves as a data access layer for performing CRUD operations and other database interactions on the `Supplier` entity. By extending `JpaRepository`, it inherits a wide range of methods for interacting with the database without requiring explicit implementation.

## Metadata
- **File Name**: `SupplierRepository.java`
- **Package**: `com.example.supplier.repository`

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `SupplierRepository` is to abstract the persistence logic for the `Supplier` entity, allowing developers to focus on higher-level business logic without worrying about the underlying database operations.

## Key Features
- **Entity**: The repository is tied to the `Supplier` entity.
- **Primary Key Type**: The primary key type for the `Supplier` entity is `Long`.
- **Spring Data JPA Integration**: By extending `JpaRepository`, the repository automatically provides methods for:
  - Saving entities (`save`)
  - Finding entities by ID (`findById`)
  - Retrieving all entities (`findAll`)
  - Deleting entities (`delete`)
  - Counting entities (`count`)
  - Custom query support

## Annotations
- **`@Repository`**: Marks the interface as a Spring-managed bean, enabling dependency injection and exception translation for database operations.

## Insights
- **No Custom Methods**: The repository currently does not define any custom methods. It relies entirely on the default methods provided by `JpaRepository`.
- **Scalability**: Additional query methods can be added using Spring Data JPA's method naming conventions or custom `@Query` annotations.
- **Entity Dependency**: The repository is tightly coupled with the `Supplier` entity. Any changes to the entity's structure may require updates to the repository.

## Dependencies
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides the `JpaRepository` interface and related functionality.
- **Supplier Entity**: Represents the domain model for which this repository is responsible.

## Example Usage
```java
@Autowired
private SupplierRepository supplierRepository;

// Save a new supplier
Supplier supplier = new Supplier();
supplier.setName("Example Supplier");
supplierRepository.save(supplier);

// Find a supplier by ID
Optional<Supplier> foundSupplier = supplierRepository.findById(1L);

// Retrieve all suppliers
List<Supplier> suppliers = supplierRepository.findAll();

// Delete a supplier
supplierRepository.deleteById(1L);
```
