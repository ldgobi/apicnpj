# Documentation: App.js

## Overview
The `App.js` file serves as the entry point for a React application focused on supplier management. It integrates components and services to provide a user interface for managing suppliers. The application includes a form for adding new suppliers and a list to display existing suppliers.

---

## Components

### **SupplierForm**
- **Description**: A React component responsible for rendering a form to create new suppliers.
- **Location**: Imported from `./components/SupplierForm`.

### **SupplierList**
- **Description**: A React component responsible for displaying a list of suppliers.
- **Location**: Imported from `./components/SupplierList`.

---

## Services

### **getAllSuppliers**
- **Description**: A function that retrieves all suppliers from the backend or a data source.
- **Location**: Imported from `./services/supplierService`.

### **createSupplier**
- **Description**: A function that handles the creation of a new supplier by interacting with the backend or a data source.
- **Location**: Imported from `./services/supplierService`.

## Code Logic

### **App Component**
- **Purpose**: Serves as the main container for the application. It renders the supplier management interface, including the form and list components.
- **Structure**:
  - A `<div>` element with the class name `App` wraps the entire application.
  - A `<h1>` element displays the title "Supplier Management".
  - The `SupplierForm` and `SupplierList` components are rendered within the `<div>`.

## Insights

- **Modular Design**: The application is structured using modular components (`SupplierForm` and `SupplierList`) and services (`getAllSuppliers` and `createSupplier`). This promotes reusability and maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The file focuses solely on rendering the main application layout, delegating specific functionalities (e.g., form handling, data fetching) to other components and services.
- **Scalability**: The use of services for data operations suggests that the application can be easily extended to include additional features, such as supplier updates or deletions.
- **React Best Practices**: The file adheres to React conventions, such as functional components and JSX syntax, ensuring compatibility with modern React development standards.
